		<p>Well for me ,in terms of programming and coding,.I learnt a tonne of things in...Lemme lost it put for you</p>
		<ul class="my-experience">
			<li>got to know that pyhton ios much more than print("Hello world")</li>
			<li>realised that python is not the only programming language</li>
			<li>Realised that half of the population was already well versed with HTML,CSS,JAVA,PYTHON,CPP(oh gosh the list never ends..)</li>
			<li>Became overwhelmed and depressed as a result(BUT..Started liking coding instead of hating it..)</li>
			<li>Messed up my routine real bad</li>
			<li>Tried juggling Assignments and coding simultaneously(FAILED!!)</li>
			<li>Made unsuccessful attempts of scoring good marks in college exams</li> 
			<li>Realised that I have to become a self-learn web developer</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
    	<p> So yeah,I successfully fucked up a lotta things.BUT...... I SURVIVED.....and I feel HAPPY about it,so should anyone who just started their coding journey..NOPZ..that doenst mean we are getting complacent.NOT.AT.ALL</p>

    	<p>We can't learn how to code decently in a single month,let alone a single week or a single....This is what makes coding soo damm interesting and mysterious at the same time.Gosh!!..ya can't get to know this guy sooo fuckin easily!! If we wanna be coding-pro,we need to embrace ourselves to fall an infinite times and  put our ass back on track an infinite times.(Warning ya already!!)

    				<p>Yes this might be a little blunt but that's what most of us need to do.We need to mind our own business and not worry about how well others are doing,what they are doing,when they are doing etc,etc.I committed this mistake and sufferred a hell lot.I couldnt code code properly beacause I became anxious and overwhelmed(the pro max level)and which pulled me into this deep pit of self-doubt instead of pushing me foward.So yeah,lesson no 1.Accept the fact that others might be ahead of you,throw the fact into dustbin and start coding at your own pace.</p>
    		</div> 
    		<div>
    			<li>Accept the fact that some people are naturally good at coding</li>
    			<img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/F4FFDF28-F50F-4DF3-A864831C8A4D1B35_source.jpg" alt="image" width="400" height="210" class="photo">
    			 	<p> Yep,some people have that innate talent of grasping that syntax really fast or applying that knowledge correctly  wihtin minutes of knowing it.Let's just accept that fact and not beat ourseleves up for getting stuck at the first question itself while Tom is busy playing badminton since he completed the whole assignment in no time.(But if Tom gets too complacent and doesnt practice the bare minimum,he is surely gonna lose the coding game.Hehehe)Strange.. is'nt it?All we mere mortals can do(me atleast) is learn,practice,apply and repeat a thousand times and beat them wiht the skills we honed even if it takes twice the effort and time.</p> 
    		</div>
    		<div>
    			<li>Practice makes a man perfect</li>

    				<p>As a rule of thumb,we need to get this thing in our heads that practicing thousands of challenges,putting lon long hours of effort are a necessity for execelling in this field.If you are tired attempting those same challenges every day,make mini beginnerprojects,tired again?listen to podcasts and hunt up you-tube to elarn new coding related things.Coding just like any other skill needs time,patience and perserverance... </p>

    			<li>Fall in love with coding</li>

                	<p>Well now you might be thinking..wait what,tis girl said she hated coding,she be tripping or wat dude??Well,yes you are right(except the tripping part).Before entering college I hated coding,I would do anything to not code.But umm..when I actually kinda started coding and familiarising myself with the concepts,I kinda started liking it.That's probably the reason I survived 2021 despite the fact that I was noob pro max.I just got up again..why? Because I kinda liked getting up to see what's next.Coding is a labour of love,you need to devote your time and lend it your love else the motivation to stay put and keep working would die after some time(Wopzie..)

    	<img src="profile.png" alt="author's photo" width="210" height="210"  class="photo" id="author_photo">
    	<p class="author-info">Hey guys I am Florence Red,a CS undergrad studying in VIT,India.Just entered into the tech field a couple of months ago.Initially,during my school years I had an aversion towards coding,used to hate it like anything.I decided to venture into the tech field merely beacuse I wanted a fat salary.(Still on the lookout for the person who said this perfectly crafted lie,big F).3 months back(When I had just entered college).I only knew that python was both a coding language and a type of snake.Yep,you can laugh as much as you want!!!)Fast foward 3 months,I learnt a little more than that and most importantly started liking to code rather than coding just for the sake of landing a job :).So,if me..a helpless and hopeless chap could survive the peer pressure and all other hurdles for 3 months,you can too..trust me you can.!!</p>
